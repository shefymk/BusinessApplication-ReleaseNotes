# New booking panel interactions

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Clicking anywhere within a recommended block of time opens the booking panel and passes in the selected time and resource.

You can still use the "hovering book" button or right-click shortcut for the same "quick book" experience you know and love. This will book the resource at the selected time in the default committed status as has been the pattern for a long time.
