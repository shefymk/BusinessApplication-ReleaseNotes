# Display notification on booking requirements grid when no results found

Resource managers often search through the booking requirements grid at the bottom of the schedule board. We wanted to make the interaction more responsive in case there are no results that match the search criteria. Instead of whitespace, a message is shown to the user.

Here's what the "no results" state looked like before:

And here's what the same state looks like after the update:
