#  Customer 360° App


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Customers, both existing and potential, leave digital footprints. Every web
search, tweet, support call, event registration, purchase, or interaction with a
connected product or digitally-intermediated service provides clues to the
intent, interests, and demographics of that person. Customer journey management
requires the unification of data silos across marketing, sales, service, and
operations. Dynamics 365 now make available a highly flexible Customer 360° app
which can be easily adapted to provide relevant insights to specific customer
facing roles like service agents, campaign managers, or sales professionals. Customer 360° reduces the time to implement “360° view of a customer” programs by orders of magnitude.
