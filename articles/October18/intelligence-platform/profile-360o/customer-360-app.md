[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Customers, both existing and potential, leave digital footprints. Every web search, tweet, support call, event registration, purchase, or interaction with a connected product or digitally-intermediated service provides clues to the intent, interests, and demographics of that person. Customer journey management requires the unification of data silos across marketing, sales, service, and operations. Knowledge build using Customer 360 eliminates data silos across business processes. Customer 360 knowledge aids to engage better with customers through personalized experience, targeted marketing etc. Customer 360 knowledge also includes predictive and actionable insights that help build customer loyalty, increase upsell potential, increase business process efficiency and reduce cost of operation.
